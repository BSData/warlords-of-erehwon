12/18/20 - First version of Ratters added.
8/19/19 - Order dice have been added.

8/15/19 - Skill descriptions updated to be complete.

8/14/19 - Reviewed Undead.

2/19/19 - Beta version is complete, all army lists are now available.  For the next few weeks I will be working on bug fixes and format fixes to make the selections better and to add spell selections.  Right now there is just a placeholder for spells to account for the points you spend, but it doesn't actually let you pick the specific spell.

Will upgrade the choice selection and armour selection process for knights/beastmen/olympian.  Those were the first lists I created and I didn't use different profiles for armour selection.
